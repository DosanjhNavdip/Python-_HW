Variable a does not change after the function call however variable b does increase to 33. They differ because since the function is asking for a list as ints input and since a is passed by value the local variable of someval is increased to 33 for a. But in the case of b it is passed by reference so when main sends the value the global value of b is incremented even if it is passed in similar ways.
